## ECS

[x] components gets registered when they are added to entities. 
this is wrong. i should register component independently.


[ ] GetComponent returns the fucking copy :(
    - solution: get rid of that reflect things use a fucking enum.
    - store them in the array as values then reference them is that so hard?

--- 

[ ] add SpriteComponent, TransformComponent and render the map
[ ] render map
[ ] make chopper move!
[ ] add key input events (debug)
[ ] camera, animations
